**HYDRO-PUMP-DEX**

1. User Goals
Your users should be able to view a list of data and see more details for a given data item on demand.
It’s up to you to come up with a type of data you want to display (see this list of public APIs for an
example); however, if you don’t have any special preferences, you can write a small Pokédex app to
display a list of Pokémon.

2. Key Features
* Load data from an external source (API)
* View a list of items
* On user action (e.g., by clicking on a list item), view details for that item
